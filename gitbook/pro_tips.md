# Pro Tips

Due to
[I/O performance issues with Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/#performance-issues-solutions-and-roadmap),
you may have the best experience using Docker Machine with [Parallels
Desktop Pro/Business](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) and
the
[corresponding Docker Machine driver](https://github.com/Parallels/docker-machine-parallels).

_Genv_ stands on the shoulders of giants. This is a tool for
convenience, and it should not be used to substitute knowledge of how to
use Docker, Docker Compose, or any of the related tools.
