# Plugins

## [Tasks](tasks.md)

Genv _task_ plugins are a great way to share simple shell helpers
with your peers, or integrate full-blown CLI apps into your Genv
environment.

## [Services](services.md)

Genv _service_ plugins enable you to share Docker Compose
configurations between multiple projects. For example, you may be
building a multi-service (or _microservice_) architecture comprised of
services that all use MySQL. Instead of running multiple instances of
MySQL, consuming valuable workstation resources, you can use Genv to
expose and manage a single instance that each of your services may use.
